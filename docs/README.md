## Planning phase
### User Experience (UX)

#### User stories

As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a reason/a value]

**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to immediately understand the main purpose of the site and if I belong to the audience it targets.
2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the website in order to find out more about the workout program and its benefits.
3. I want to find the subscription plan options, what features they include and their respective pricing. 
4. I want to be able to subscribe for a free trial period.
5. I want to be able to get in touch with the company, in order to address any questions that I may have.
6. I want to find the links to their social media pages.
7. I want to sign up for their newsletter, in case there is a special discount to join the program at a lower rate.

Future user stories should include visitors that are returning to the website, but have not subscribed yet and the paid members, who will access the main website to get to the paid members-only dedicated area


#### Strategy

<details>
<summary>Project Goals</summary>
The purpose of this project is to build a static front-end site, using mainly HTML5 and CSS3. The website should provide enough data in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while helping users achieve their goals. 

In this project, the main goal is to make sure that the user learns about a workout program for expecting and postpsartum mothers offered by the fictional company "Paus" and joins one of the subscription plans. Therefore, the project can create value for both the customers and the company, by providing an interesting and valuable product/service for the user and generating income for the company.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Business Goals</summary>
The main goal of the website is to increase sales of subscriptions to attract paid members and keep existing members by having a website with enough information for a visitor to see value and make a decision to join. This is the first ever developed website for "Paus".

**Audience:** the website target English-speaking expecting or postpartum mothers in the age range 18-45 worldwide, since all classed are available online both on-demand and live stream, depending on the subscription plan. The target audience has busy schedules. Currently they are looking for alternatives to stay active at home due to self isolation / lockdown due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, since pregnant and postpartum women are part of a risk group.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Customer Goals</summary>
Prospective members / first website visitors: get to know the company "Paus" and the benefits of the workout program, compare plans and potentially subscribe to one of the options. 

In the future, after development of the members-only section, the existing members will wish to access the program through the website.
</details>

#### Scope

The scope defines which features will be implemented and which will not be implemented at this stage. 
The following features will be included in the current project's scope:

The main items of the website will be included as sections within one page (scrollable single page).
The scrollable single page is a good option to prevent visitors to navigate away, reducing the number of steps for a potential customer to make a decision to join the workout program.

A fixed bar at the top with the logo and login section will be used to facilitate finding the navbar. The navbar will hide when scrolling and reading the sections, but appear when hovering, providing a shortcut to other sections of the website independently of where the visitor is browsing at the moment.

The design should be feminine, calm, modern and signal connection to nature and wellness.

- **Home:** The visitor should be able to get a feel for and identify the target audience and product/service immediately. This will be achieved by a big hero video and a keywords of the benefits that the program offers, with icons that create metaphors.

- **How it Works:** The visitor should know what to expect from the program and the steps to enroll for the program. This section includes example imagery to grab the attention of website visitors.

- **Subscription Plans:** This section presents the membership options and compares them. The comparison should include features, pricing and if any free trials are available and for how long. This is also a good place to promote the download of the optional mobile app, increasing value for prospective members that are considering joining by showing that the program is convenient and available on the go.

- **About Us:** It should provide information about the company.

- **Contact:** This section provides a form to contact the company.

- **Footer:** links to social media, newsletter opt-in form and shortcut to go back to the top after all the scrolling.

Other features can be implemented, like the paid members-only page. For more information on future features, see the "Future Features" section.

#### Structure

A single page so the user can keep on the website and not navigate away, providing few steps for the user to make a decision to subscribe to a workout plan.

Relevant information should be displayed in a consistent and intuitive manner so that it grabs the attention of the user, while providing the information that the user needs in order to see value in the workout plan as a convenient solution to the user's problems.

The most importent content is large and centered, including the logo which is fixed and follows while scrolling, which is good for branding. The users can easily get to any other section from the point they are so scrolling does not become tiresome.

The site consists of the following pages: Home, How it Works, Subscription Plans, About Us and Contact.
The header includes a fixed bar with the logo and the login section, as well as a navbar on hover.
The footer shows the logo and provides important information about social media links, newsletter opt-in and a shortcut arrow back to the top.

The user is greeted with a nice and big hero video.

#### Skeleton

This section illustrates the first draft of the website and how the information will be presented.

<details>
<summary>Wireframes</summary>

- A first draft was sketched by hand on paper and then Balsamiq was used for the final wireframes.
[Balsamiq wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrinecl/milestone-project1/master/docs/wireframes/paus-wireframe.png).

Adaptations of the layout for the following screen sizes to ensure responsiveness:

![Color Palette](https://github.com/adrinecl/milestone-project1/blob/master/docs/images/paus-color-palette.png)


###### Typography

- The following fonts were chosen for this project: "Quicksand" for the logo and headings and "Montserrat" for the body, with the alternative of sans-serif as back-up. Available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=Quicksand#standard-styles).

###### Imagery

- The photos and videos used should be high quality and modern, while conveying a sense of warmth and comfort. This way it can depict that the workout program can be easily done at home. The videos and photos should portray expecting mothers exercising, meditating and just a sense of wellbeing that they are fully enjoying their pregnancies.
